Title: Pihana Ka `Ikena o Kaua`i

Description:
The company I chose is a nonprofit organization that I am a part of called Pihana Ka `Ikena o Kaua`i, a traditional Hawaiian healing arts school/organization. My next steps include finding out what the client wants and needs out of the website/app that I would be making for them. (eg. what info do they want to include, what kind of info they may need to store, do they need a donation button or forms, etc.) I am choosing this project because it is near and dear to my heart and I couldn’t think of anyone I’d want to help more than my halau and the timing happens to be perfect.

I think I will encounter many, many roadblocks from the beginning until the end. From trying to envision and plan what the product will look like with the client to the nitty gritty of how it will actually work will all pose roadblocks, I’m sure of it. I think I will come to multiple points where I think I’ve come to the edge of my abilities like I have on every project. I hope to find a way to push through each and every one. Finishing the css, I believe, will be the hardest thing of all. I have no idea how long this project will take but I don’t see it taking any less than 2-3 months, probably more. I plan to spend anywhere between 2-6 hours every weekday on this project. I most look forward to working with the clients to envision and deliver a meaningful and user-friendly product.
